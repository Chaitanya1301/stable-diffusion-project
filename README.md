# 🌟 Stable Diffusion Project

This repository contains the implementation of **Stable Diffusion**, a state-of-the-art **text-to-image generation model**. The project includes a **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation, documentation, and a detailed report on findings.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Stable Diffusion is a **deep learning model** that generates **high-quality images from text prompts**. It uses **latent diffusion models** to iteratively refine images, making it one of the most powerful AI-based image generation tools.

🔹 **Model:** Latent Diffusion  
🔹 **Framework:** PyTorch  
🔹 **Dataset:** Pretrained on LAION-5B  
🔹 **Applications:**
   - AI Art Generation 🎨
   - Image-to-Image Transformations 🖼️
   - Text-to-Image Generation ✍️ → 🖼️
   - Creative Content Generation 🚀
